Caret keyboard layouts for one-handed ortholinear/column-staggered keyboards.

I used [michaeldickens/Typing](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) with custom scoring to optimize for a 4x8 ortholinear keyboard, then reduced to 4x7.  The home keys are "ARET".  When reducing further down to 2x4, combos/chords are used.  A 5th row may be added for the thumb to type, e.g. space, shift, backspace, etc.

## Combos
The usage is similar to [Artsey](https://artsey.io/) or [Ardux](https://ardux.io/), but the combo designations are different.

* Frequent characters use combos with fewer keys or combos that are easier to type.  E.g. space, D, and L are frequent characters, and they are assigned to 3-key or 4-key combo in Artsey.  2-key combos are used here instead.  For V in Artsey, you need to lift up ring finger while pressing down pinky and middle finger, and that is difficult.  Here, you do so for X, Q, and Z.
* Lessen same-finger usage in sequence.  This is difficult to do since most characters use combos, and there are only 4 fingers.  But at least there is no same-finger usage on "THE".
* Use combo for the most frequent bigram "TH".
* Use combo for each symbol, instead of SHIFT layer.  E.g. In Artsey, double-quote requires "SHIFT" then "quote", and ampersend requires "shift", "number layer (hold)", then "7".  No SHIFT is needed here, but more combos to memorize.
* Both one-shot and locked modifiers are available.
* Both left-hand and right-hand modifiers are available.  Some software (e.g. virtual machines viewer) require distinction between left modifiers and right modifiers.
* Cursor movement keys are available in held layers instead of locked layers.  I think this is more convenient.
