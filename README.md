Caret keyboard layouts for one-handed ortholinear/column-staggered keyboards.

I used [michaeldickens/Typing](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) with custom scoring to optimize for a 4x8 ortholinear keyboard, then reduced to 4x7.  The home keys are "ARET".  When reducing further down to 2x4, combos/chords are used.

## Combos
The usage is similar to [Artsey](https://artsey.io/) or [Ardux](https://ardux.io/), but the combo designations are different.

* Common characters use combos with fewer keys.  E.g. space, D, L are common characters, and they require 3 to 4 keys to type using Artsey.  2-key combos are used here.
* Lessen same-finger usage in sequence.  This is difficult since most characters use combos, and there are only 4 fingers.  But at least there is no same-finger usage on "THE".
* Use combo for the most common digram "TH".
* Use combo for each symbol, instead of SHIFT layer.  E.g. In Artsey, double-quote requires "SHIFT" then "quote", and ampersend requires "shift", "number layer (hold)", then "7".  No SHIFT is needed here, but more combos to memorize.
* Both one-shot and locked modifiers are available.
* Both left-hand and right-hand modifiers are available.  Some software (e.g. virtual machines viewer) require distinction between left modifiers and right modifiers.
* Cursor movement keys are available in held layers instead of locked layers.  I think this is more convenient.
